# 07 — Beyond the list

> Written 7 Oct 2026 (app 0.67), BEFORE the features below are built — the owner's rule for these ideas:
> "please document this very thoroughly so that we have that locked down". Each part is updated from the code in
> the version that builds it; until then it is the agreed design, and where the code later differs, the code wins
> and the difference is listed under *Open questions*.

This chapter covers the ideas the owner chose on 7 Oct 2026 from a set of "out of the box" proposals, in the
order they are built, and the ones he turned down (so no one proposes them again). Features that change existing
screens are ALSO described in those screens' chapters (03 trips, 04 templates, 05 things and Care, 06 settings);
this chapter holds the parts that span several screens and the decisions behind them.

| Part | Version | Status |

| 2. Sections renamed, reordered and removed from a thing's page | 0.68 | building |
| 3. Places opened by a printed code (no stickers — his word, 7 Oct) | 0.69 | building |
| 4. Search finds words in notes | 0.69 | building |

Parts 1–6 are specified in their screens' chapters by the version that builds them; their summaries here point
there. Parts 7–10 are specified in full below.

---

## 1–6. Summaries (details in the screens' chapters)

1. **The keyboard on a thing's page (Mac only).** Tab / Shift-Tab walk every field in reading order; lists answer
   type-ahead, Space opens, ↑/↓ move, Return chooses inside an open list; Return SAVES the page from anywhere
   except Notes (new line) and an open list (his choice, 7 Oct 2026); ⌘S saves, Esc cancels; ⌘N saves and opens a
   new thing carrying over Kind of thing, Whose it is, Kept at home, Usually packed in, When and the templates;
   ⌘↓ / ⌘↑ save and open the next / previous thing of the list the page came from; ⌘J jumps to a field by name;
   a "Thing" menu lists them. Keys chosen to work on a Swedish keyboard (no ⌥ letters, no [ or ]). → spec 05.
2. **Sections from a thing's page.** In the Section list of each template on a thing's page: rename (pen), order
   (up/down), remove (asks first; the things stay, with no section). Applied on Save; Cancel undoes. → spec 04/05.
3. **Places opened by a code.** A place (Your choices → Places) can be shown as a printed square code; the iPhone's
   Camera opens it, and it opens the trip on that place's lines (or what goes back there on the way home, or
   everything kept there). NFC stickers were planned and dropped the same day ("let's skip the NFC"). → spec 05/06.
4. **Search finds notes.** Your things and Search match a thing's own Notes and the notes its templates keep for
   it; the matching note shows under the name. → spec 05.
5. **Bag pockets and "Where is my …?"** Bags have pockets; a thing a usual pocket; a trip line the pocket it went
   into; Siri and Search answer bag + pocket. → spec 03/05.
6. **The door check.** "I leave at" on a trip's first (and last) day; 15 minutes before, one notification names
   what is still unticked (on the way home: not yet in a bag). His choice of trigger: a time he sets (7 Oct 2026),
   not location and not the car. → spec 03/06.

## 7. Apple Health fills in the review

### What he sees

After a trip, the review (Trips → a trip → Review) opens with a block **"From Apple Health"** above the lines:
the workouts logged between the trip's first and last day, one row per kind, for example

- "Swim · indoor · 3 times"
- "Run · outdoor · 2 times"
- "No bike" (shown only for a workout template that is on the trip and had no workout)

and a button **"Use these"**. Pressing it marks the review's lines:

- lines from a workout template whose workout WAS done → used (as the review already assumes);
- lines from a workout template whose workout was NOT done at all → "didn't use";
- lines from a workout template done only in the OTHER context (only indoor swims, but the line's place on the
  template is for Outdoor only) → "didn't use";
- every other line (common base, transport, a non-workout template) → unchanged.

Every mark stays his to change before Save; nothing is saved by "Use these" alone. A line he had already
answered by hand keeps his answer. Without workouts on those days, the block says "No workouts in Apple Health
for these days" and offers nothing.

### Which workout meets which template

Each workout template is matched by its name (the same normalised name rule as the workout colours,
`WorkoutTone`), unless he links it himself on the template's page ("Counts as: Swim" — a drop-down of the kinds
below plus "Nothing"; stored on the template, synced and backed up like its other fields).

| Apple Health workout | Template it meets | Context from the workout |
|---|---|---|
| Swimming | Swim | pool → Indoor; open water → Outdoor (Apple Health's swimming location) |
| Cycling | Bike | indoor workout → Indoor; otherwise Outdoor |
| Running | Run | indoor workout → Indoor; otherwise Outdoor |
| Traditional / functional strength training, core training | Strength | Indoor |
| Yoga, mind and body, flexibility, breathing-type workouts | Mobility & Breath work | — |
| Hiking | Hiking | Outdoor |
| Golf | Golf | Outdoor |
| Climbing | Climbing | indoor workout → Indoor; otherwise Outdoor |
| Underwater diving | Diving and Freediving | Outdoor |
| anything else | — (ignored) | — |

"Race" cannot be read from Apple Health: a line for Race only is left as it is.

### Rules and edge cases

- **Days:** from the trip's first day 00:00 to its last day 23:59, in the time zone of the device. An undated trip
  gets no block.
- **Two trips on the same days:** each review reads the same workouts; that is correct (he was on both).
- **A workout without its gear** (a run on the treadmill of a hotel): it still marks the Run template's things as
  used — the app cannot know; he corrects the few lines by hand.
- **Things for someone else** (Whose it is ≠ him): left unchanged — his workouts say nothing about hers.
- **Things on two templates** (a towel on Swim and on the common base): the common base wins — unchanged.
- **Workouts logged later** (a watch synced after the review opened): "Use these" reads again each time it is
  pressed.
- **Permission:** asked the first time the block would show, with the words "AMS Packing reads your workouts
  during a trip to suggest what you used. It never writes to Apple Health." Refused → the block says "Apple Health
  is not allowed — Settings → Privacy → Health" and nothing else changes.
- **Read only.** The app never writes to Apple Health. Nothing read leaves the device; only the review answers
  (used / didn't use) are synced, as today.
- **iPhone only.** The Mac has no Apple Health: its review shows no block; a review answered on the iPhone reaches
  the Mac as any other review.

### Release

An app that reads Apple Health carries the HealthKit entitlement. Workout Sync showed (30 Sep 2026) that GitHub's
cloud-signed archive can lose it; the owner allowed (7 Oct 2026) that such versions are archived and uploaded from
his Mac when GitHub cannot sign them. The release step checks the archived app's entitlements and stops if
`com.apple.developer.healthkit` is missing — a version without it would show no block and say nothing.

### Tests (planned)

- Model (PackingLibrary, with invented workouts — no Apple Health in tests): mapping table above, contexts, the
  "Counts as" link, done / not done / other context, his own answers kept, someone else's things unchanged, the
  common base unchanged, an undated trip.
- UI (`-uiTestingHealth` launch argument feeding invented workouts): the block's rows by id
  (`review-health-row-N`), "Use these" (`review-health-use`) marking the expected lines, and nothing saved until
  Save; each seen red with a planted fault.

## 8. A trip page in his Obsidian vault

### What he gets

When a trip's review is saved — and whenever he presses **"Send to Obsidian"** on a reviewed trip — the trip
becomes one Markdown page in the folder he picked once (his choice, 7 Oct 2026: the vault's `Areas/Travel`),
named `<yyyy-mm> <trip name>.md`. Writing it again replaces the page (the same name).

### The page

- Front matter: `type: trip`, `start`, `end`, `nights`, `place`, `transport`, `season`, `templates` (names),
  `packed` (lines packed / lines), `weight` (all bags, kg), `reviewed` (date).
- Sections: **Weather** (as the trip recorded it), **Workouts** (from part 7, when read), **Bags** (each bag with
  its weight and its packed photos, copied into an `attachments` folder beside the page and linked),
  **Didn't use**, **Missed** (added at the review), **Bought on site**, **Notes** (maintenance notes like "zip
  broken", each with its thing's name).
- Plain Markdown, no plug-ins needed. No personal data beyond what he typed into the trip.

### Where it is written

The folder lives on the Mac, so the **Mac** writes the page: on the Mac's next launch (or at once, when the Mac app
is open) for a review saved on the iPhone, and at once for "Send to Obsidian". The folder is chosen with the
system's folder picker and remembered as a security-scoped bookmark, the same way as WatchLater's export. Without
a folder, the button asks for one. A folder that has gone away → the button says so and asks again.

### Tests (planned)

Model: the page's text for the sample trip (front matter, sections, names in invented data). UI on the Mac (probe):
the button, the picker answered by a test folder (`-uiTestingVault <path>`), the file written.

## 9. Kits — things that hold things

His words (7 Oct 2026): some things are "already existing as a permanently packed item consisting of items" —
"a TechPouch with power bank, some cables, a microphone, an iPhone stand", "a Hiking-Pouch consisting of a screw
driver inside, a knife, a light, a Leatherman, some tape". He said yes to kits on 7 Oct.

- **A kit is a thing** with a list of the things inside it (its contents), set on its page ("Inside: …" — a list
  with Add from your things). Its contents are real things with their own weight, care, condition and Valid until.
- **One level deep.** A kit can go in a bag; a kit cannot go inside another kit; a thing is in at most one kit.
- **On a trip** a kit is ONE line: "Tech pouch · 6 inside", with a fold arrow showing the contents (muted, not
  ticked separately). Ticking the kit packs it. Its contents are never separate lines on a trip.
- **Check before each trip** (optional, on the kit's page): the contents then show as small ticks under the kit's
  line, and the kit counts as packed only when all are ticked.
- **Taken out.** A thing taken out of its kit (on the thing's page or from the kit's fold) is marked "taken out";
  the kit's line then says "1 missing: knife" until it is put back.
- **Weight** of a kit = its own + its contents. **Care**: a content's Valid until or care warning also shows on the
  kit ("plasters expire in May").
- **Templates hold the kit**, not its contents. A content that is ALSO on a template on its own is pointed out on
  the thing's page ("Also inside the Hiking pouch").
- **"Where is my …?"** answers "Hiking pouch, in the backpack".
- Model: a kit is an item with `kitContents` (ids) and `kitCheck` (bool); a content has `insideKitId`; stored,
  synced and backed up with the item. The web app knows nothing of kits: parity must treat them as plain items.

## 10. Hands-free packing (a test version)

His yes of 7 Oct 2026, in English (his choice). Built in 0.71 from this design; what follows is the code.
Files: the walk's decisions in `Core/Sources/PackingLibrary/VoiceWalk.swift` (no speech in it — the model
tests hold it); speaking and listening in `App/Sources/Voice/` — `VoiceIO.swift` (the protocol and the UI
tests' fake), `DeviceVoice.swift` (the iPhone's own voice and ears), `VoiceWalker.swift` (runs one walk),
`VoicePanel.swift` (the button and the panel). All of `App/Sources/Voice` is `#if os(iOS)`: **the Mac has no
button and none of this code** (the Mac app is built without it).

### The button

On a trip (`TripScreen`), at the END of the Sorting row — "Sorting", its drop-down, then **Pack by voice**
(`VoiceSortingRow` wraps the row): an outlined green capsule (green words and a drawn microphone `MicMark`,
18 pt, on 10 % green, 1.4 pt green stroke), `Metrics.tap` tall (36) like the drop-down's field, the words
Subheadline semibold; id **`voice-start`**, accessibility label "Pack by voice". On an iPhone too narrow for
"Sorting", the drop-down showing "From where" and "Pack by voice" on one line, the button says **Voice**
(`ViewThatFits`: the first of the two rows that fits). The drop-down's field takes what the button leaves.

Never grey (his rule): pressed when the walk cannot start, the reason is said under the row in red
(Subheadline semibold, id **`voice-start-needs`**), and nothing opens:
- nothing to pack — every line ticked or set aside: "Everything on this trip is packed or set aside.";
- speech recognition not allowed: "Packing may not understand speech. Allow it in Settings → Privacy &
  Security → Speech Recognition.";
- microphone not allowed: "Packing may not use the microphone. Allow it in Settings → Privacy & Security →
  Microphone.";
- no English recognised on this iPhone by itself: "This iPhone cannot yet understand English by itself. Add an
  English keyboard with Dictation on (Settings → General → Keyboard), then try again.";
- the recogniser busy: "Speech recognition is not ready just now. Try again in a moment.";
- the microphone cannot be opened: "The microphone could not be opened just now. Try again in a moment."
The next press clears the line first. The first press asks for both permissions (the system's own questions,
with the usage texts below); a later press asks nothing.

**Usage texts** (Info.plist, from project.yml): microphone — "Pack by voice listens for packed, skip, later,
where and stop while you pack. What you say stays on this iPhone."; speech recognition — "Pack by voice
understands your five words on this iPhone itself, without the internet. Nothing you say leaves it."

### The walk (`VoiceWalk`)

- **Which lines, in which order:** the trip's lines NOT ticked and NOT set aside, in the trip's **From where**
  order (`groupByStorage`: places A–Z, "No place set" last; inside a place the trip's own line order) —
  whatever sorting the trip screen shows. The walk is fixed when it starts; a line ticked or set aside
  meanwhile (by the other device) is passed over without being asked.
- **A start place** (`VoiceWalk(trip:startAt:)`, `VoiceSortingRow(startAt:)`): the walk begins at that place
  and goes round — that place, the places after it, then the ones before. Compared by `Library.choiceKey`
  ("garage" is the Garage). A place the trip does not have, or one with nothing left, is no start: the walk
  begins at the first place. For a place opened by its printed code (part 3): the place's link opens the trip
  on that place, and whoever opens it passes the place on. (0.71 builds the start; the link side is part 3's.)
- **What it says** (an English voice; names as written; "Name, 4" when a line counts more than one —
  `effectiveQty` with the trip's laundry-capped nights):
  - first: "7 to pack. Bathroom cabinet. Toothbrush." — how many, the place, the thing;
  - the next thing in the same place: just the thing, "Phone charger.";
  - the first thing of a new place: the count, then the place: "Bathroom cabinet done, 1 of 7. Chest of
    drawers. Passport." The count is the trip's own — ticked / lines not set aside, as `trip-progress` shows;
  - after every **5** answers in one place (`VoiceWalk.progressEvery`; packed, skip and later count): the
    count first, "5 of 7. Thing 6.";
  - **where**: the place and the thing again, "Garage. Headlamp." (nothing moves on);
  - **stop**: "Stopped. 2 of 6 packed." — and the walk ends;
  - the end of the list: "That was everything. 6 of 7 packed." and, when some were left, " 1 left for later.";
  - something heard that is none of the words: "Sorry?" — and it listens again.
- **The five words** and what they do to the line being asked about (`VoiceWalk.action`, applied by
  `Library.apply` — one `model.change`, exactly as a tap does):
  | Word | The line | Then |
  |---|---|---|
  | packed | ticked (`setChecked(true)`) | the next thing |
  | skip | set aside — "not this time", as ⊘ does (`setAside(true)`, its tick goes too) | the next thing |
  | later | left as it is, unticked | the next thing; named under "Left for later" at the end |
  | where | left as it is | the place and the thing are said again |
  | stop | left as it is | the walk ends |
- **Forgiving words** — ONE list, `VoiceWord.accepted`, which is also what the recogniser is told to expect
  (`contextualStrings`):
  - packed: packed, pack, packs, packed it, pack it, packet, pact, backed, got it, have it, done, yes, yeah,
    yep, ok, okay, check, tick, ticked, in the bag;
  - skip: skip, skipped, skips, skipping, skip it, not this time, set aside, aside, leave it, nope, not needed,
    dont need it, not taking it;
  - later: later, later on, next, next one, not yet, after, afterwards, pass, come back, move on;
  - where: where, wheres, where is it, where is that, wear, were, ware, repeat, again, say again, pardon,
    sorry, what, which place;
  - stop: stop, stop it, stopped, end, quit, finish, finished, enough, cancel, all done, im done, thats all,
    thats it, halt.
  Matching (`VoiceWord.heard`): lower case, an apostrophe left out ("that's" → "thats"), every other mark a
  space; then the FIRST phrase in what was heard wins ("where did I pack it" is where), and at one place the
  longest ("all done" is stop, "done" alone packed). Left out on purpose: a bare "no" (often the start of
  something else — "no wait, packed"), "back", and "wait" (he is looking for it: the walk should wait, not move
  on). "Next" is **later** (it moves on and leaves the line unticked).

### Speaking and listening (`DeviceVoice`, iPhone)

- **Voice:** `AVSpeechSynthesizer`, the system's English voice for the chosen English (`AVSpeechSynthesisVoice`),
  default rate.
- **Ears:** `SFSpeechRecognizer` with **`requiresOnDeviceRecognition`** — it works offline, and nothing he says
  leaves the iPhone; partial results on, punctuation off, task hint "confirmation" (short answers).
- **Which English:** his iPhone's own when it is US or British English; otherwise British, then American — the
  first this iPhone recognises by itself (`supportsOnDeviceRecognition`).
- **It never listens while it speaks** (so it cannot hear its own "Garage done …"): each line is said, and only
  when it has been said does listening start. A word is acted on as soon as it is heard (from the partial
  result); words that are none of the five count as said when he pauses for **1.2 s** (or the recogniser
  finishes) — then "Sorry?". When the recogniser gives up on silence it listens again without a word; after
  more than 5 such rounds in a row it stops: "Listening stopped working. Start again in a moment."
- **Sound:** the audio session is play-and-record: the loudspeaker when nothing is plugged in, **AirPods**'
  microphone allowed in (Bluetooth hands-free), other sound (music) quieter while it runs. AirPods put in or
  taken out: the microphone is started again on the new route.
- **Ended without his word:** a call, Siri or another app taking the sound — "Stopped by a call or another
  app."; the microphone lost — "The microphone could not be opened just now. Try again in a moment."; Packing
  put away (the iPhone stops listening in the background) — "Stopped when Packing was put away." Said on the
  panel in red (id `voice-cut`). **The screen stays on** while a walk runs (`isIdleTimerDisabled`), so it is not
  locked by itself mid-walk.

### The panel (`VoicePanel`, a sheet over the trip, id `voice-panel`)

While it runs (a swipe down does not close it — Stop does):
- Header: "Pack by voice" (Title 3 bold, green) and a small outlined "A test" (Caption semibold, muted).
- A line: a dot (green while listening, `Theme.line` while speaking) and "Listening" / "Speaking" (Subheadline
  semibold muted, id `voice-listening`); at the right the trip's count "1 of 7 packed" (id `voice-progress`).
- The big card (card fill, 1.2 pt green border, radius 14, padding 16): the place (Title 3 semibold green, id
  `voice-place`) and the thing as said (Large Title bold ink, up to 3 lines, shrinking to 60 %; id
  `voice-current`).
- **Said** — the last line it spoke (Callout, id `voice-said`) — and **Heard** — what it heard, in quotes (id
  `voice-heard`): a word it misheard can be seen.
- At the bottom, outside the scroll, always there: the five words as buttons, 50 pt tall (Apple's large button
  — to be hit while carrying things), Title 3 semibold, radius 12: **Packed** (filled green) and **Skip**;
  **Later** and **Where** (outlined green); **Stop** (outlined red) on a line of its own. Ids
  `voice-word-packed`, `-skip`, `-later`, `-where`, `-stop`. A tap does what the word does (and counts as tapped,
  not heard).

When it is over (Stop, the end of the list, or cut short): the word buttons go; **Done** (filled green, header,
id `voice-done`) closes the panel (and so does a swipe down). The card says the last words it spoke (Title 3,
id `voice-said`), what it did — "Packed 2 · set aside 1 · later 1" (id `voice-summary`), **his measure** —
"Understood 6 of 7 times" (heard words understood / everything heard that was taken as an answer or a miss;
"· 2 tapped" when buttons were used; "Nothing heard" when none; id `voice-understood`), and the time — "Took 2
min 10 s · 3.1 things a minute" (packed + skip + later per minute; id `voice-time`); then "Left for later: …"
(id `voice-later`, only when some were) and, under the card, every answer in order, one line each:
"Toothbrush · packed · “packed it”", "Passport · skip · tapped" (ids `voice-log-0…`). Nothing of a walk is
stored: it lives as long as its panel.

### How he evaluates it (the test)

It is kept only if, on a real trip: it understands him **at least 9 times in 10** (the panel's "Understood N
of M times", and the log shows each miss), it is **faster than tapping** (the panel's time and things a
minute, against packing the same kind of list by hand), and **he wants to use it again**. Otherwise it is
removed and the decision log says so. Until then it is labelled a test on the panel, in How it works and in
What's new.

### Tests

- Model (`Core/Tests/PackingLibraryTests/VoiceWalkTests.swift`, 13, invented things):
  `testEachOfTheFiveWordsIsUnderstoodAsItIsWritten`, `testWhatIsHeardIsMatchedForgivingly` (31 sayings),
  `testOtherWordsAreNotUnderstood` (incl. "no", "wait", "back"), `testTheFirstWordWinsAndTheLongestPhrase`,
  `testTheListIsOneListAndEveryPhraseCanBeHeard` (no phrase in two lists, each written as heard, each
  understood), `testTheWalkGoesFromWhereAndLeavesOutWhatIsDone`, `testAWalkCanStartAtAPlace`,
  `testAThingOfSeveralSaysHowMany`, `testTheWalkSaysThePlaceThenTheThingAndTheCountAtEachNewPlace`,
  `testEveryFiveThingsInOnePlaceItSaysTheCount`, `testTheEndOfTheListSaysSo`, `testALineTickedMeanwhileIsPassedOver`,
  `testItCountsWhatItUnderstoodAndWhatWasTapped`.
- UI (iPhone only — each skips on the Mac, which has no button): the speech is a fake (`ScriptedVoice`), chosen
  under ANY `-uiTesting…` launch, so no test opens a microphone. `-uiTestingVoice "a,b,c"` makes it hear those
  words, one after each thing said (a beat each); `-uiTestingVoice ""` hears nothing (the buttons drive);
  `-uiTestingVoiceRefused` refuses the microphone.
  - `testPackByVoiceWalksTheTripByTheWordsItHears` — heard "Packed it, hello, skip, next, where is it, pack,
    stop": the panel ends "Stopped. 2 of 6 packed.", "Packed 2 · set aside 1 · later 1", "Understood 6 of 7
    times", "Left for later: Phone charger", the six log lines; Done; the trip "2/6 · 1 set aside", the
    Toothbrush and the Headlamp ticked, the Passport set aside, the Phone charger neither.
  - `testPackByVoiceButtonsDoWhatTheWordsDo` — `voice-start` after the Sorting field on its line, as tall (±4),
    on the screen; the Toothbrush in the Bathroom cabinet first, "7 to pack.
    Bathroom cabinet. Toothbrush.", "0 of 7 packed", five word buttons; Packed → the Passport, "Bathroom cabinet
    done, 1 of 7. Chest of drawers. Passport."; Skip → "Phone charger."; Later → "Chest of drawers done, 1 of 6.
    Garage. Headlamp."; Where → "Garage. Headlamp." and no move; Stop → over, no word buttons, "Stopped. 1 of 6
    packed.", "Nothing heard · 5 tapped"; Done; the trip "1/6 · 1 set aside". Pictures `voice-trip-button`,
    `voice-panel`, `voice-over`.
  - `testPackByVoiceSaysWhyItCannotStart` — refused: `voice-start-needs` names the microphone and no panel
    opens; after Tick everything: "Everything on this trip is packed or set aside." and no panel.
- Not covered by any test (judged on his iPhone): the real voice and recognition, AirPods, a call cutting in,
  Packing put away, a narrow iPhone's "Voice".

### Open questions (part 10)

- At the end of the list the walk stops; the lines left for later are named, not asked again. A second round
  over them is a small change if he wants it.
- "Next" was made **later** (moves on, unticked); "done" and "yes" are **packed**. If he uses a word the list
  does not have, the log shows it — add it to `VoiceWord.accepted` (one place).
- The start place is accepted (part 3's link passes it); whether a place opened by its code should START the
  walk by itself, or only start it there when he presses the button, is his call — 0.71 does the latter.

## 11. Decision log

| Date | Decision | His words / reason |
|---|---|---|
| 7 Oct 2026 | No PackPoint-style features (trips from the calendar, a daily weather strip, starter lists, trip types, several places per trip, country basics, per-traveller views, Lock Screen progress) | "None of these ideas are good enough for our splendid app." |
| 7 Oct 2026 | No race trips made from the training plan | Races happen too seldom. |
| 7 Oct 2026 | No bag balancer (moving things between bags to meet airline limits) | Not worth it. |
| 7 Oct 2026 | No gear wear counted from Apple Health (kilometres per pair of shoes) | He runs in different shoes. |
| 7 Oct 2026 | No Home Screen widget | His "No" on the timeline. |
| 7 Oct 2026 | No second shared field test ("Packing Quest 2") | Not needed; move on. |
| 7 Oct 2026 | No NFC stickers on places (the printed code stays) | "Let's skip the NFC." |
| 7 Oct 2026 | Door check by a time he sets | Chosen over location and the car. |
| 7 Oct 2026 | Return saves a thing's page; ⌘N carries over the choices; the keyboard work is Mac only | His three answers. |
| 7 Oct 2026 | Voice in English; vault folder `Areas/Travel`; Apple Health versions may be uploaded from his Mac | His answers. |

## Open questions

- "Change" for sections (part 2) was taken as the ORDER of the sections; if he meant something else, change part 2.
- "The road to 1.0" (all web-app features in, a real trip, a real restore, a quiet week): kept or dropped — his word
  is pending.
